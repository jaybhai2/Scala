# Installation and Basic Usage
## Open your plugin definition file (or create one if doesn't exist). You can use either:

the global file (for version 0.13 and up) at ~/.sbt/SBT_VERSION/plugins/plugins.sbt
the project-specific file at PROJECT_DIR/project/plugins.sbt
Add sbteclipse to the plugin definition file:

Version 6.x+ will only support SBT 1.0+ when it is released. Use 5.2.4 or older for previons versions of SBT
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "5.2.4")
In sbt use the command eclipse to create Eclipse project files

> eclipse

In Eclipse use the Import Wizard to import Existing Projects into Workspace
